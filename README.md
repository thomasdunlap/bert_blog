# WordPhantom

**Under Construction**

I love building machine learning software, however real-world jobs also require significant work time devoted to writing proposals, creating PowerPoints, writing blog posts, and other business oriented tasks where I stare longingly at my computer wishing to dive back into the code.

That's where WordPhantom comes in. It scrapes the web and creates rough drafts of your business documents for you (eventually!)

Current state usage:

* `git clone https://github.com/thomasdunlap/wordphantom.git`
* `cd wordphantom`
* Set up a clean Python3 virtual environment (conda, virtualenv, etc.)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python wordphantom.py "your google search" "/path/to/WordDoc.docx"`


Stay tuned! :D
